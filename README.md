## Overview
This is a web-based bookstore management system developed using CakePHP as part of my internship experience. The project helped me gain practical knowledge and experience in using the CakePHP framework, focusing on the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, **unit testing**, and **debugging**. It also showcases my skills in setting up Docker environments for web applications.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Users can browse through a list of books with details like author, publisher, and category.
- **Category-Based Search**: Books can be filtered by categories and publishers for more precise searching.
- **User Authentication**: Secured access for publishers and administrators.
- **Responsive UI**: User-friendly interface built for a seamless experience across devices.
- **Pagination**: Manage large datasets by displaying a limited number of results per page.

## Skills Gained
- **MVC Architecture**: Worked extensively with the CakePHP framework, understanding the separation of concerns between Models, Views, and Controllers.
- **CakePHP**: Enhanced understanding of CakePHPâ€™s routing, ORM, validation, and behavior systems.
- **Unit Testing**: Integrated **PHPUnit** for testing various parts of the application, ensuring code quality and stability.
- **Debugging**: Improved my ability to debug issues using CakePHP's debugging tools and error handling.

## Technologies Used
- **CakePHP 3.10**: Web application framework for PHP.
- **MySQL**: Relational database to store book, user, and category data.
- **Docker**: Containerization to handle the local development environment.
- **PHPUnit**: Unit testing framework for automated testing.

## Conclusion
This project gave me hands-on experience with building real-world web applications using CakePHP, Docker, and MySQL. It helped me sharpen my skills in **back-end development**, **testing**, and **debugging**, making me more confident in tackling complex projects in the future.
